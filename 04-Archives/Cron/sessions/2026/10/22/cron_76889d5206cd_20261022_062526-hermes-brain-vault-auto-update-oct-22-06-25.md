[IMPORTANT: You are running as a scheduled cron job. DELIVERY: Your final response will be automatically delivered to the user — do NOT use send_message or try to deliver the output yourself. Just produce your report/output as your final response and the system handles the rest. SILENT: If there is genuinely nothing new to report, respond with exactly "[SILENT]" (nothing else) to suppress delivery. [SILENT] is a literal ASCII control token — never translate or rephrase it, whatever language the rest of your answer uses. Never combine [SILENT] with content — either report your findings normally, or say [SILENT] and nothing more. FAILURE: If a delegated child fails and this cron run must be recorded as failed, put [CRON_FAILURE] on the first line by itself, then explain the child failure on following lines. RECURSION: This is a run of an EXISTING scheduled job — execute the task now. NEVER create or update a cron job because of recurring or future-schedule language in the task prompt below; treat phrasing like "each Monday" or "every day at 9" as context for this run, not as a request to schedule another job.]

You are checking the Hermes Brain Obsidian vault at '/hermes/Brain/Hermes Brain' for template updates and applying them ONLY if it's safe to do so automatically. This vault's git 'origin' remote already IS the template repo (mistrysiddh/hermes-brain-template). NEVER resolve merge conflicts automatically. NEVER commit/snapshot uncommitted local changes automatically — only a human-run manual update should do that.

Steps:
1. cd into the vault path above.
2. Run `git status --short`. If there is ANY uncommitted change or untracked file, STOP immediately and report: 'Vault has uncommitted changes (list them) — skipping auto-update, run it manually.' Do not commit anything on the user's behalf in this automated job.
3. If the working tree is clean, run `git fetch origin` then compare HEAD against origin/main with `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD`. If it succeeds (already up to date), reply with a short 'Vault already up to date at version X' (read VERSION) and stop.
4. If origin/main has new commits, run `git merge origin/main --no-edit`.
5. If the merge succeeds with NO conflicts, read VERSION (new value) and report success with old->new version and a one-line summary of what changed (from `git log --oneline <old-HEAD>..HEAD` or the CHANGELOG.md diff). Personal content (Daily/, Memory-Review/*, Projects/* beyond README, plugin data.json files) is protected by the vault's own .gitignore throughout and is never touched by this.
6. If the merge reports CONFLICTS, do NOT attempt to resolve them. Run `git status --short` to list the conflicting files, then run `git merge --abort` to cleanly back out (leave the vault exactly as it was before this run), and report: 'New template update available but conflicts with your local edits in: <file list>. Run the update manually to resolve.'
7. Keep the final report short — a few lines, not a wall of text. This message is the only thing the user sees from this automated run.

There are uncommitted changes in the vault — stopping per instructions without touching anything.

**Vault auto-update skipped.** Working tree has uncommitted changes:
- Modified: `.obsidian/graph.json`
- Untracked: dozens of cron session archive files under `04-Archives/Cron/sessions/2026/10/{08–22}/`

Run the update manually to review/commit these first.
